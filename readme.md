# Coly Programming Language

**Update**: I'm thinking of switching the language from Julia to Dart, because Julia is really slow and hard to maintain.
I will also be changing the syntax of Coly completely.

## THIS IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES, LONG FROM PRODUCTION READY!
Please do not use this yet, the syntax will likely have major changes during development.

## Goals
My goal is to create a stack-oriented language with modern features.

**Aims:**

- Easy to learn
- Consice syntax with short keywords
- Type conversion
- Dynamically typed
- Interpreted & compiled

## Working on
- Keyword checker (before runtime)

## Todo
- File I/O
- Proper loops
- Deprecate labels

## Done
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Interpreter
- [x] Control-Flow
- [x] CMD calls
- [x] Macro's
- [x] Preprocessor
- [x] Macro fetcher 
- [x] Include files
- [x] Call arguments
- [x] Parser
- [x] Iterable data type (List)
