# SSBL
 Simple Stack Based Language (Temporary name)

## THIS IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES, LONG FROM PRODUCTION READY!
Please do not use this yet, the syntax will likely have major changes during development.

## Goals

The idea is to create a stack-based language with modern features.

I am trying to implement an interpreter first, 

a compiler might come later on in development.

## Todo
 - [x] basic Lexer
 - [x] basic interpreter
 - [x] arithmetic OP's
 - [x] Proper print / out command
 - [ ] Keyword Identifier...
 - [ ] Control flow (if, end)
