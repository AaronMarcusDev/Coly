# Coly Programming Language üê¶

Coly is a open-source, high-level, compiled stack-oriented programming language.\
 It supports both compilation and interpretation on Windows and Linux. Think of it like a minimalist cousin to Forth or Factor, but with its own flavor.

```c
"Hello, Coly!" puts
```

## üß™ Core Concepts
Since Coly is stack-based, it operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. You push values onto the stack and apply operations that consume or manipulate them.

Example:

```c
5 3 + puts
```

This would push 5 and 3 onto the stack, apply +, and then print the result.

## üßæ Commands
 While there's no formal documentation yet, here are the commands:
 
 | Command | Description |
 | --------| -----------|
 | puts | 	Prints the top value on the stack |
 | + - * / |	Arithmetic operations |
 | dup	| Duplicates the top stack value |
 | drop| 	Removes the top stack value |
 | swap| 	Swaps the top two values |
 | over| 	Copies the second value to the top |

## üìÑ Documentation
There is no official documentation for Coly **yet.**
