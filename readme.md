# Coly Programming Language

**Update**: I'm switching the bootstrap-language from Julia to Dart, because Julia is really slow and hard to maintain.
I will also be changing the syntax of Coly completely.

## THIS IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES, LONG FROM PRODUCTION READY!
Please do not use this yet, the syntax will likely have major changes during development.

## Goals
My goal is to create a stack-oriented language with modern features.

**Aims:**

- Easy to learn
- Consice syntax with short keywords
- Type conversion
- Dynamically typed
- Interpreted & compiled

## Working on
Currently rewriting the entire language in Dart.\
I will also be making a compiler for Coly.
